# Legal & Ethics Policy for AI Bug Hunter

## Overview
This document outlines the legal and ethical guidelines for using the AI Bug Hunter framework. All users must read, understand, and agree to these policies before using the system.

## Core Principles

### 1. Authorization Required
- **NEVER** test systems you do not own or have explicit written permission to test
- Obtain proper authorization before conducting any security testing
- Maintain documentation of all authorizations
- Respect scope limitations defined in authorization agreements

### 2. Responsible Disclosure
- Follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices
- Report findings to appropriate parties before public disclosure
- Allow reasonable time for remediation (typically 90 days)
- Do not exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain

### 3. Data Protection
- Minimize data collection to what is necessary for security testing
- Do not access, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive data
- Immediately stop testing if personal or sensitive data is encountered
- Securely delete any inadvertently collected sensitive data

## Scope Definition

### In-Scope Activities
✅ **Permitted:**
- Passive reconnaissance on publicly available information
- Subdomain enumeration using public sources
- Port scanning of owned/authorized systems
- Web application security testing with permission
- Certificate transparency log analysis
- Public DNS record analysis
- OSINT gathering from public sources
- Vulnerability scanning of authorized targets

### Out-of-Scope Activities
❌ **Prohibited:**
- Testing without explicit authorization
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical security testing
- Denial of service attacks
- Data exfiltration or modification
- Privilege escalation beyond proof-of-concept
- Testing of third-party systems without permission
- Bypassing rate limiting or security controls

## Legal Compliance Checklist

### Before Starting Any Assessment
- [ ] Written authorization obtained and documented
- [ ] Scope clearly defined and agreed upon
- [ ] Legal review completed (if required)
- [ ] Insurance coverage verified (if applicable)
- [ ] Emergency contact information available
- [ ] Incident response plan in place

### During Assessment
- [ ] Stay within defined scope
- [ ] Document all activities with timestamps
- [ ] Stop immediately if unauthorized access is gained
- [ ] Report critical findings promptly
- [ ] Maintain confidentiality of findings

### After Assessment
- [ ] Secure all evidence and findings
- [ ] Provide detailed report to authorized parties
- [ ] Delete any sensitive data collected
- [ ] Follow up on remediation efforts
- [ ] Maintain records per retention policy

## Safe Disclosure Workflow

### 1. Initial Discovery
- Document the vulnerability thoroughly
- Assess potential impact and exploitability
- Verify the finding is legitimate
- Check if it's already known/reported

### 2. Notification Process
- Contact the organization's security team
- Use established vulnerability disclosure channels
- Provide clear, actionable information
- Include proof-of-concept (non-destructive)

### 3. Coordination
- Allow 5-7 business days for initial response
- Work with the organization on timeline
- Provide additional details if requested
- Respect confidentiality agreements

### 4. Follow-up
- Verify remediation when notified
- Coordinate public disclosure if appropriate
- Share lessons learned (anonymized)

## Rate Limiting and Respectful Testing

### Network Behavior
- Implement reasonable delays between requests
- Respect robots.txt and security.txt files
- Monitor for rate limiting responses
- Reduce scan intensity if servers show stress

### Default Rate Limits
- **Subdomain enumeration:** 10 requests/second max
- **Port scanning:** 100 ports/second max
- **Web fuzzing:** 5 requests/second max
- **API testing:** 2 requests/second max

### Monitoring Guidelines
- Watch for HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses
- Monitor server response times
- Stop testing if errors increase significantly
- Implement exponential backoff for retries

## Data Handling and Privacy

### Evidence Collection
- Collect only what is necessary for proof-of-concept
- Avoid collecting personal information
- Redact sensitive data in reports
- Use synthetic data for demonstrations

### Storage Requirements
- Encrypt all evidence at rest
- Use secure transmission channels
- Implement access controls
- Maintain audit logs of data access

### Retention Policy
- Keep evidence only as long as necessary
- Delete data after report delivery (unless required)
- Securely wipe storage media
- Document destruction of sensitive data

## Incident Response

### If Unauthorized Access Occurs
1. **STOP** all testing immediately
2. Document what happened
3. Notify the target organization immediately
4. Cooperate fully with investigation
5. Review and improve processes

### If Sensitive Data is Encountered
1. **DO NOT** access or download the data
2. Stop testing in that area immediately
3. Notify the organization promptly
4. Document the finding without exposing data
5. Recommend immediate remediation

### Emergency Contacts
- **Legal Counsel:** [Contact Information]
- **Security Team Lead:** [Contact Information]
- **Client Emergency Contact:** [To be filled per engagement]

## Training Requirements

### Mandatory Training
- [ ] Legal and ethical hacking principles
- [ ] Responsible disclosure practices
- [ ] Data protection and privacy laws
- [ ] Incident response procedures
- [ ] Tool-specific safety training

### Ongoing Education
